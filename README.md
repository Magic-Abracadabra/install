# Execute this snippet, and then: Importing is Installing!
[ðŸŽ¬ Demo](https://github.com/Magic-Abracadabra/magic-install/blob/main/Demo.mp4)

A brief way to use your codes. Just copy the source code to start with.
```python
from pip import main
from importlib.metadata import distributions
installed_packages = [dist.metadata['Name'] for dist in distributions()]
normal_import = __builtins__.__import__

def install(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0):
	__builtins__.__import__ = normal_import
	if name not in installed_packages:
		main(['install', '-U', name])
	name = normal_import(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)
	__builtins__.__import__ = install
	return name

__builtins__.__import__ = install


# start coding from here
```
Usually, everything will get done for you. Modules of the latest version can be installed before your following imports.

If you don't have numpy,
```python
import numpy as np
```
will install numpy first, and then numpy will be successfully installed. Yeah, that easy.

After import one package, the following libraries will work, too:
```python
import pyaudio, pymovie, pyautogui, ...
```
